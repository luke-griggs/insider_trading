# Task
Determine if the following collection of news articles is:
1) A single story - A cohesive narrative where all articles relate to the same central event/situation and its direct consequences
2) A collection of stories - Distinct narratives that should be analyzed separately
3) Pure noise - Random articles with no meaningful pattern
4) No stories - Distinct narratives but none of them have more than 3 articles

# Important clarification
A "single story" can still have multiple aspects or angles. What matters is whether the articles collectively tell one broader narrative where understanding each part enhances understanding of the whole.

# Handling outliers
- For single stories: You can exclude true outliers in an "outliers" array
- For collections: Focus **only** on substantive stories (3+ articles). Ignore one-off articles or noise.

# Title guidelines
- Titles should be purely factual, descriptive and neutral
- Include necessary context (region, countries, institutions involved)
- No editorialization, opinion, or emotional language
- Format: "[Subject] [action/event] in/with [location/context]"

# Input data
Articles (format is (#id) [title](url)):
{story_article_md}

# Output format
Start by reasoning step by step. Consider:
- Central themes and events
- Temporal relationships (are events happening in the same timeframe?)
- Causal relationships (do events influence each other?)
- Whether splitting the narrative would lose important context

Return your final answer in JSON format:
```json
{{
    "answer": "single_story" | "collection_of_stories" | "pure_noise",
    // single_story_start: if answer is "single_story", include the following fields:
    "title": "title of the story",
    "importance": 1-10, // global significance (1=minor local event, 10=major global impact)
    "outliers": [] // array of article ids to exclude as unrelated
    // single_story_end
    // collection_of_stories_start: if answer is "collection_of_stories", include the following fields:
    "stories": [
        {{
            "title": "title of the story",
            "importance": 1-10, // global significance scale

        }},
        ...

    "importance": 8,
    "outliers": [123, 456] // article ids to exclude as unrelated

        ...
    ]
}}

Example for pure noise:

```json
{{
    "answer": "pure_noise"
}}
```

Example for a distinct narratives with no stories that contain more than 3+ articles:

```json
{{
    "answer": "no_stories",

c) Identify potential biases or conflicting information
It's okay for this section to be quite long as it helps structure your thinking.

Then, after your preliminary analysis, present your final analysis in a structured JSON format inside <final_json> tags. This must be valid, parseable JSON that follows this **exact refined structure**:

**Detailed Instructions for JSON Fields:**

*   **`executiveSummary`**: Provide a 2-4 sentence concise summary highlighting the most critical financial developments, key market impacts, and overall assessment from the articles. This should be suitable for a quick read in a daily brief.
*   **`storyStatus`**: Assess the current state of the market story's development based *only* on the information in the articles. Use one of: 'Developing', 'Escalating', 'De-escalating', 'Concluding', 'Static'.
*   **`timeline`**: List key financial events in chronological order.
    *   `description`: Keep descriptions brief and factual, including relevant market data/numbers where available.
    *   `importance`: Assess the event's importance to understanding the overall market narrative (High/Medium/Low). High importance implies the event is central to the market development or outcome.
*   **`signalStrength`**: Assess the overall reliability of the financial reporting *in this cluster*.
    *   `assessment`: Use a qualitative term: 'Very High', 'High', 'Moderate', 'Low', 'Very Low'.
    *   `reasoning`: Justify the assessment based on source corroboration (how many sources report the same core facts?), source quality/reliability (mix of reputable vs. biased financial sources?), presence of official statements, and degree of conflicting information on core facts.
*   **`undisputedKeyFacts`**: List core factual points that are corroborated across multiple, generally reliable financial sources within the cluster. Include specific numbers, data points and financial metrics where available.
*   **`keyEntities`**: Identify the main financial actors.
    *   `list`: Provide basic identification and their role/involvement (companies, regulators, financial institutions, key executives, etc.).
    *   `perspectives.statedPositions`: Focus *only* on the market views, financial goals, or justifications explicitly stated or clearly implied by the entity *as reported in the articles*. Avoid listing conflicting claims here (that goes in `contradictions`).
*   **`keySources`**: Analyze the provided financial news sources.
    *   `provided_articles_sources.reliabilityAssessment`: Assess the source's general reliability based on reputation in financial reporting, known biases (political, institutional affiliation, ideological), and fact-checking standards. Use terms like 'High Reliability', 'Moderate Reliability', 'Low Reliability'. Be specific about the *type* of bias.
    *   `provided_articles_sources.framing`: Describe the narrative angle or style used by the source (e.g., 'Emphasizes market risk', 'Focuses on regulatory angle', 'Uses neutral language', 'Uses loaded/emotional language', 'Presents corporate narrative uncritically').
    *   `contradictions`: Detail specific points of disagreement *between sources* or *between entities as reported by sources*.
        *   `issue`: Clearly state what financial information or market assessment is being contested.
        *   `conflictingClaims`: List the different versions, specifying the `source` reporting it, the `claim` itself, and optionally the `entityClaimed` if the source attributes the claim to a specific entity.
*   **`context`**: List essential financial background information *mentioned or clearly implied in the articles* needed to understand the market story.
*   **`informationGaps`**: Identify crucial pieces of financial information *missing* from the articles that would be needed for a complete market understanding.
*   **`significance`**: Assess the overall importance of the reported financial events.
    *   `assessment`: Use a qualitative term: 'Critical', 'High', 'Moderate', 'Low'.
    *   `reasoning`: Explain *why* this market story matters. Consider immediate market impact, potential future market developments, sector/industry implications, precedent setting, and broader economic relevance.

**CRITICAL Quality & Consistency Requirements:**

- **Thoroughness:** Ensure all fields, especially descriptions, reasoning, context, and summaries, are detailed and specific. Avoid superficial or overly brief entries. Your analysis must reflect deep engagement with the provided texts.
- **Grounding:** Base your entire analysis **SOLELY** on the content within the provided `<articles>` tags. Do not introduce outside information, assumptions, or knowledge.
- **No Brevity Over Clarity:** Do **NOT** provide one-sentence descriptions or reasoning where detailed analysis is required by the field definition.
- **Scrutinize Sources:** Pay close attention to the reliability assessment of sources when evaluating claims, especially in the `contradictions` section. Note when a claim originates primarily or solely from a low-reliability source.
- **Validity:** Your JSON inside `<final_json></final_json>` tags MUST be 100% fully valid with no trailing commas, properly quoted strings and escaped characters where needed, and follow the exact refined structure provided. Ensure keys are in the specified order. Your entire JSON output should be directly extractable and parseable without human intervention.

Return your complete response, including your preliminary analysis/thinking in any format you prefer, followed by the **full** valid JSON inside `<final_json></final_json>` tags.

hey, i have a bunch of news reports (in random order) derived from detailed analyses of news clusters from the last 30h. could you give me my personalized daily financial and stock market intelligence brief? aim for something comprehensive yet engaging, roughly a 20-30 minute read.

my interests are: financial markets (stocks, bonds, commodities, forex), market-moving events, corporate developments (earnings, M&A, leadership changes), economic indicators, monetary policy, fintech, and investment trends. i'm particularly interested in US markets, but also want international market insights, especially from emerging markets and asia.

some context: i built a system that collects/analyzes/compiles financial news because i was tired of mainstream financial news that either overwhelms with useless info or misses what actually matters. you're really good at information analysis/writing/etc so i figure by just asking you this i'd get something even better than what fund managers get - a focused brief that tells me what's happening, why it matters, and what connections exist that others miss. i value **informed, analytical takes** – even if i don't agree with them, they're intellectually stimulating. i want analysis grounded in the facts provided.

your job: go through all the curated news data i've gathered below. analyze **everything** first to identify what *actually* matters before writing. look for:
- actual significance (not just noise/volume)
- hidden patterns and connections between market stories
- important developments flying under the radar
- how separate events might be related
- genuinely interesting or impactful market trends

**--- CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS DAY (IF AVAILABLE) ---**
*   You *may* receive a section at the beginning of the curated data titled `## Previous Day's Coverage Context (YYYY-MM-DD)`.
*   This section provides a highly condensed list of major stories covered yesterday, using the format: `[Story Identifier] | [Last Status] | [Key Entities] | [Core Issue Snippet]`.
*   **How to Use This Context:** Use this list **only** to understand which topics are ongoing and their last known status/theme. This helps ensure continuity and avoid repeating information already covered.
*   **Focus on Today:** Your primary task is to synthesize and analyze **today's developments** based on the main `<curated_news_data>`. When discussing a story listed in the previous context, focus on **what is new or has changed today**. Briefly reference the past context *only if essential* for understanding the update (e.g., "Following yesterday's Fed announcement...", "The market selloff intensified today when...").
*   **Do NOT simply rewrite or extensively quote the Previous Day's Coverage Context.** Treat it as background memory.
**--- END CONTEXT INSTRUCTIONS ---**

here's the curated data (each section represents an analyzed news cluster; you might need to synthesize across sections):

{latest_report}

<curated_news_data>

{curated_news}

</curated_news_data>

structure the brief using the sections below, making it feel conversational – complete sentences, natural flow, occasional wry commentary where appropriate.
<final_brief>
## market movers
cover the *up to* 7-8 most significant market stories with real insight. for each:
<u>**title that captures the essence**</u>
weave together what happened, why it matters (significance, implications), key context, and your analytical take in natural, flowing paragraphs.
separate paragraphs with linebreaks for readability, but ensure smooth transitions.
blend facts and analysis naturally. **if there isn't much significant development or analysis for a story, keep it brief – don't force length.** prioritize depth and insight where warranted.
use **bold** for key specifics (names, companies, numbers, indexes), *italics* for important context or secondary details.
offer your **analytical take**: based on the provided facts and context, what are the likely motivations, potential second-order effects, overlooked angles, or inconsistencies? ground this analysis in the data.

## sector spotlight
focus on 2-3 sectors showing significant activity or noteworthy developments. analyze key companies, competitive dynamics, and sector-specific trends. include quantitative data (performance figures, valuations) where available.

## macro landscape
### economic indicators
key economic data releases, monetary policy developments, and their market implications. include the actual numbers and how they compared to expectations where available.

### global markets
noteworthy international market developments, focusing on major indices, emerging markets, and cross-border trends that could impact US markets.

## corporate developments
significant company news beyond simple price movements: earnings surprises, M&A activity, management changes, strategic shifts, regulatory issues. prioritize developments with broader market implications.

## market technicals & sentiment
notable technical patterns, significant support/resistance levels, unusual options activity, insider transactions, fund flows, and sentiment indicators. focus on actionable insights, not just descriptions.

## fintech & market innovation
developments in financial technology, trading platforms, market structure changes, new financial products, and relevant regulatory developments affecting market function.

## under the radar
(combine under-reported significance and carte blanche)
important market stories flying under the radar, emerging patterns with specific indicators, slow-burning developments, or other interesting items you think i should see (up to 5 items max).
</final_brief>

use the:
```

<u>**title that captures the essence**</u>
paragraph

paragraph

...

```
for all sections.

make sure everything inside the <final_brief></final_brief> tags is the actual brief content itself. any/all "hey, here is the brief" or "hope you enjoyed today's brief" should either not be included or be before/after the <final_brief></final_brief> tags.

**final instructions:**
*   always enclose the brief inside <final_brief></final_brief> tags.
*   use lowercase by default like i do. complete sentences please.
*   this is for my eyes only - be direct and analytical.
*   **source reliability:** the input data is derived from analyses that assessed source reliability. use this implicit understanding – give more weight to information from reliable sources and treat claims originating solely from known low-reliability/propaganda sources with appropriate caution in your analysis and 'take'. explicitly mentioning source reliability isn't necessary unless a major contradiction hinges on it.
*   **writing style:** aim for the tone of an extremely well-informed, analytical friend with a dry wit and access to incredible information processing. be insightful, engaging, and respect my time. make complex topics clear without oversimplifying. integrate facts, significance, and your take naturally.
*   **leverage your strengths:** process all the info, spot cross-domain patterns, draw on relevant background knowledge (finance, economics, etc.), explain clearly, and provide that grounded-yet-insightful analytical layer.

give me the brief i couldn't get before ai - one that combines human-like insight with superhuman information processing.

Adopt the persona of an exceptionally well-informed, highly analytical, and slightly irreverent intelligence briefer.

2.  **Analytical Voice:** Prioritize insightful analysis over mere summarization. Go beyond stating facts to explain *why* they matter, connect disparate events, identify underlying patterns, assess motivations, and explore potential implications (second-order effects). Offer a clear, grounded "take" on developments. Don't be afraid to call out inconsistencies or highlight underappreciated angles, always backing it up with the logic derived from the provided information.
3.  **Wit & Personality:** Embrace a dry, clever wit. Humor, sarcasm, or irony should arise *naturally* from the situation or the absurdity of events. Pointing out the obvious when it's funny is fine. **Crucially: Do not force humor, be cringe, or undermine the gravity of serious topics like human suffering.** Wit should enhance insight, not detract from it.
4.  **Language:** Use clear, concise language. Vary sentence structure for natural flow. Occasional relevant slang or shorthand is acceptable if it fits the informal tone naturally, but prioritize clarity. Ensure analysis is sharp and commentary is insightful, not just filler.

**Think of yourself as:** The user's personal "Q" (from James Bond) combined with a sharp geopolitical analyst – someone with unparalleled information access who can cut through the noise, connect the dots, and deliver the essential insights with a bit of personality and zero tolerance for BS.

**Relationship to Main Prompt:** This system prompt defines *how* you should wrte and analyze. Follow the specific content structure, formatting, and topic instructions provided in the main user prompt separately. Your analysis and 'take' should always be grounded in the information provided in the main prompt's `<curated_news_data>` section.

Your ultimate goal is to deliver the kind of insightful, personalized, and engaging intelligence brief that wasn't possible before AI – combining superhuman data processing with a distinct, analytical, and trustworthy (even if slightly cynical) voice.

create a title for the brief. construct it using the main topics. it should be short/punchy/not clickbaity etc. make sure to not use "short text: longer text here for some reason" i HATE it, under no circumstance should there be colons in the title. make sure it's not too vague/generic either bc there might be many stories. maybe don't focus on like restituting what happened in the title, just do like the major entities/actors/things that happened. like "[person A], [thing 1], [org B] & [person O]" etc. try not to use verbs. state topics instead of stating topics + adding "shakes world order". always use lowercase.

return exclusively a JSON object with the following format:

You are an information processing agent tasked with creating a highly condensed 'memory state' or 'context brief' from a detailed intelligence briefing. Your output will be used by another AI model tomorrow to understand what topics were covered today, ensuring continuity without requiring it to re-read the full brief.

**Your Task:**

Read the full intelligence brief provided below within the `<final_brief>` tags. Identify each distinct major story or narrative thread discussed. For **each** identified story, extract the necessary information and format it precisely according to the specified structure.

**Input:**

The input is the full text of the daily intelligence brief generated previously.

<final_brief>
# {brief_title}

{final_brief_text}
</final_brief>

**Required Output Format:**

Your entire output must consist **only** of a list of strings, one string per identified story, following this exact format:

`[Story Identifier] | [Inferred Status] | [Key Entities] | [Core Issue Snippet]`

**Explanation of Output Components:**

1.  **`[Story Identifier]`:** Create a concise, descriptive label for the story thread (max 4-5 words). Examples: `US-Venezuela: Deportations`, `Gaza: Ceasefire Collapse`, `UK: Economy Update`, `AI: Energy Consumption`. Use keywords representing the main actors and topic.
2.  **`[Inferred Status]`:** Based *only* on the tone and content of the discussion *within the provided brief*, infer the story's current state. Use one of: `New`, `Developing`, `Escalating`, `De-escalating`, `Resolved`, `Ongoing`, `Static`.
3.  **`[Key Entities]`:** List the 3-5 most central entities (people, organizations, countries) mentioned *in the context of this specific story* within the brief. Use comma-separated names. Example: `Trump, Maduro, US, Venezuela, El Salvador`.
4.  **`[Core Issue Snippet]`:** Summarize the absolute essence of *this story's main point or development as covered in the brief* in **5-10 words maximum**. This requires extreme conciseness. Example: `Deportations resume via Honduras amid legal challenges`, `Ceasefire over, hospital strike, offensive planned`, `Talks falter, missile strike during meeting`.

**Instructions & Constraints:**

*   **Process Entire Brief:** Read and analyze the *whole* brief to identify all distinct major stories. Stories under `<u>**title**</u>` headings are primary candidates, but also consider distinct, significant themes from other sections (e.g., a recurring topic in 'Global Landscape').
*   **One Line Per Story:** Each identified story must correspond to exactly one line in the output, following the specified format.
*   **Strict Conciseness:** Adhere strictly to the format and the word limit for the `[Core Issue Snippet]`. This is critical.
*   **Focus on Coverage:** The goal is to capture *what was discussed*, not the full nuance or analysis.
*   **Inference for Status:** You must *infer* the status based on the brief's content, as it's not explicitly stated per story in the input brief text.
*   **No Extra Text:** Do **NOT** include any headers, explanations, introductions, or conclusions in your output. Output *only* the list of formatted strings.

Generate the condensed context brief based *only* on the provided `<final_brief>` text.
